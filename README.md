# Succless Android
An index of android apps that sucks less

This is an effort to index the most awesome apps because Play Store have a pretty bia$ed recommendation system and often the best apps out there
are not in Play Store.

We can exchange suggestions about which app is awesome and more people should know about it.

## Rules
- Native apps are not a rule but preferred
- If the app does not use a tracking or ad mechanism it's better
- Android only (so far)
- The simple approach is preferred over the complex
- Traits of the apps should be defined using tags, like `has-dark-mode`
- More information: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)
