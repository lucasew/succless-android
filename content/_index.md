# Welcome

This is a community repository for recommended Android apps.

If you look for new apps you often get confused about the quality of the apps recommended by Play Store.

Sometimes there are some scam apps, adware, apps that do simple things but are huge in size and resource usage,
buggy, only works decently if you pay for the PRO version and so.

This is a repo of apps that we know and trust that do not do this kind of thing, apps that solve the problem
and sometimes are incredibly minimal in size and in some cases even working on really old phones and android versions.
